Star Rating Module
===========================
Star Rating is an extension that allows  the addition of a rating system
your eZ publish content objects via a datatype.

If the xajax module has been installed and the user has javascript enabled
voting will occur via ajax calls.

The extension has been designed with accessability in mind and will function
without javascript, images or CSS.

The current version allows ratings between 1 and 5 stars and users can vote
once per session.

The Star Rating module contains images and CSS from Komodo media
